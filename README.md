# News Site

The task is to create a news site that is responsive to different screen sizes. 
The site should contain: 
    -header
    -main news article, 
    -grid of news articles

Desktop 4 columns
Tablet 2 columns
Mobile 1 column

# The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

First, I browsed existing news websites and created an "inspiration - board" on Figma.
Then I drew an outline of the website and how things should look- the basic skeleton.
Problems encountered were solved mostly by a lot of googling, stack overflow, youtube videos and group discussions on slack.
On this website, I started my design/coding with the desktop view, so one thing I will do better next time is to start with the mobile view and add media queries for other views.
